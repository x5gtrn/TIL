# Managing Life with GitHub: TIL and LIFE Repositories

I learned about the "manage your life with GitHub" approach by watching the following two videos:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHiq6nf0Jio
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNLE7rQDLN0

These approaches don't just confine everything to GitHub alone, but involve operations using Claude Code, aiming to build something that can serve as a personal secretary within a year.

I read this reference article:

- https://zenn.dev/hand_dot/articles/85c9640b7dcc66

Learning about TIL (Today I Learned) for the first time, I decided to create both a LIFE repository and a TIL repository, and start operating them from today. The operational rules I conceived at this time are documented in the README.md files I committed to each repository today:

- https://github.com/x5gtrn/LIFE-Template/blob/2affefeb529b8cfcb39b7841a8bb1298a748104c/README.md
- https://github.com/x5gtrn/TIL/blob/3e3ed669bd3dd36eb70f1350ac7676efe6b76064/README.md

For the TIL repository, I want to reference the following actual personal repositories:

- https://github.com/simonw/til
- https://github.com/jbranchaud/til

The term "Learn in Public" was also new to me. The following articles provide detailed explanations:
